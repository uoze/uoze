💻 Graduate of Fullstack Academy's Web Development Fellowship, please ask me anything about my projects (pinned below)!

🦐 My background is in Zoology, so I am no stranger to tackling novel, specialized subjects and making sense of them. (My favorite animal is the red panda, but there's no emoji for it... and I have a red cherry shrimp planted aquarium!)

🏞 When I was an urban park ranger in NYC, I engaged heavily with the public, and saw the great value of proper communication, especially in simplifying a complex topic to something both digestible and enjoyable by everyone. And that is where my career transition comes in: what better way to communicate with as many people as possible than through software!


### Currently
